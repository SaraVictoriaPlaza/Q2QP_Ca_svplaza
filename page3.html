  <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
  <p>We are the filipinos who support the no to jeepney phase out campaign.
    And we this organizations have been managed to defend and strive this advocacy
    until we reach victory. Although this imprint as a challenge, giving up was never 
    a choice; We as a citizen of the Philippines, should and must defend our own trademarks.
  </p>

<div id="Mission" class="seccontent">
  <h1>MISSION</h1>
  <p>
    "What we propose is to address the root cause of poverty and inequality. Under neoliberal globalization, labor flexibilization and modernization schemes have become rampant resulting to job insecurity. With 4.7 percent conservative estimate of unemployment rate in the country and whopping 7.7 million (18 percent) underemployed Filipinos in January 2017 alone, the productive forces remain stagnant and industrial development is stunted. Over 30 million Filipinos consider themselves as extremely poor, while the total net worth of the richest continue to grow. The economy also suffers backwardness and underdevelopment, being export-oriented and import-dependent."

<div id="Vision" class="seccontent">
  <h1>VISION</h1>
  <p>"We demand that the government uphold the workers’ rights and the national economic interest by amending department orders, plans, and agreements that are bias towards capitalists and public-private partnerships. We must advocate for pro-poor comprehensive urban and rural transportation planning that complements national industrialization and genuine agrarian reform. The government must resume with the peace talks and push for the Comprehensive Agreement on Social and Economic Reforms (CASER), which tackles land reform and workers’ welfare."</p>
